# oidc-provider

[![build][travis-image]][travis-url] [![codecov][codecov-image]][codecov-url]

oidc-provider is an OpenID Provider implementation of [OpenID Connect][openid-connect]. It allows to
export a complete mountable or standalone OpenID Provider implementation. This implementation does
not dictate a fixed data model or persistence store, instead, you must provide adapters for these.
A generic in-memory adapter is available to get you started as well as feature-less dev-only views
to be able to get off the ground.

## Get started
You may check the [example folder](/example) or follow a [step by step example][example-repo] to see
which of those fits your desired application setup.

The examples bundled in this repo's codebase are available for you to experiment with
[here][heroku-example]. Dynamic Registration is open, you can literally register any client you want
there.   An example client using this provider is available [here][heroku-example-client] (uses
[openid-client][openid-client]).

Also be sure to check the available configuration docs section.


## Configuration and Initialization
oidc-provider allows to be extended and configured in various ways to fit a variety of uses. See
the [available configuration](/docs/configuration.md).

```js
const Provider = require('oidc-provider');
const configuration = {
  // ... see available options /docs/configuration.md
};
const clients = [{
  client_id: 'foo',
  client_secret: 'bar',
  redirect_uris: ['http://lvh.me:8080/cb'],
  // + other client properties
}];

const oidc = new Provider('http://localhost:3000', configuration);

let server;
(async () => {
  await oidc.initialize({ clients });
  // express/nodejs style application callback (req, res, next) for use with express apps, see /examples/express.js
  oidc.callback

  // koa application for use with koa apps, see /examples/koa.js
  oidc.app

  // or just expose a server standalone, see /examples/standalone.js
  server = oidc.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('oidc-provider listening on port 3000, check http://localhost:3000/.well-known/openid-configuration');
  });
})().catch((err) => {
  if (server && server.listening) server.close();
  console.error(err);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```


## Debugging
oidc-provider uses the [debug][debug-link] module internally to log information about various states
of authentication requests, errors and grants. To see all these set the `DEBUG` environment variable
to `oidc-provider:*` when launching your app.

There is no filter on what is included in the debug output, since it may end-user Personally
identifiable information or client credentials it's use is only advised for debugging, not regular
logging. Use emitted events to cherry pick the one's of interest to your flows and form your own
logs aware of what should and should not be a part of a logged message.


## Events
Your oidc-provider instance is an event emitter, using event handlers you can hook into the various
actions and i.e. emit metrics or that react to specific triggers. In some scenarios you can even
change the defined behavior.  
See the list of available emitted [event names](/docs/events.md) and their description.
