# oidc-provider

[![build][travis-image]][travis-url] [![codecov][codecov-image]][codecov-url]

oidc-provider is an OpenID Provider implementation of [OpenID Connect][openid-connect]. It allows to
export a complete mountable or standalone OpenID Provider implementation. This implementation does
not dictate a fixed data models or persistence store, instead, you must provide adapters for these.
A generic in memory adapter is available to get you started as well as feature-less dev-only views
to be able to get off the ground.

Notice: ^2.0.0 oidc-provider only works with Node.JS >= 8.0.0 and introduces many breaking changes,
for LTS/4 and LTS/6 use the [^1.0.0](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/tree/v1.x) semver
range. Updating from ^1.0.0? See the [CHANGELOG](/CHANGELOG.md)

Updates to draft and experimental specification versions are released as MINOR library versions,
if you utilize these specification implementations consider using the tilde `~` operator in your
package.json since breaking changes may be introduced as part of these version updates.

## Get started
You may follow an example [step by step setup][example-repo] (recommended), or run and experiment with an
example server that's part of the repo (if you can follow the structure, if not check the step by step).

The example bundled in this repo's codebase is available for you to experiment with [here][heroku-example].
Dynamic Registration is open, you can literally register any
client you want there.  
An example client using this provider is available [here][heroku-example-client]
(uses [openid-client][openid-client]).


## Configuration and Initialization
oidc-provider allows to be extended and configured in various ways to fit a variety of uses. See
the [available configuration](/docs/configuration.md).

```js
const Provider = require('oidc-provider');
const configuration = {
  // ... see available options /docs/configuration.md
};
const clients = [{
  client_id: 'foo',
  client_secret: 'bar',
  redirect_uris: ['http://lvh.me:8080/cb'],
  // + other client properties
}];

const oidc = new Provider('http://localhost:3000', configuration);
oidc.initialize({ clients }).then(function () {
  console.log(oidc.callback); // => express/nodejs style application callback (req, res)
  console.log(oidc.app); // => koa2.x application
});
```


## Debugging
oidc-provider uses the [debug][debug-link] module internally to log information about various states
of authentication requests, errors and grants. To see all these set the DEBUG environment variable
to oidc-provider:* when launching your app.

There is no filter on what is included in the debug output, since it may end-user Personally
identifiable information or client credentials it's use is only advised for debugging, not regular
logging. Use emitted events to cherry pick the one's of interest to your flows and form your own
logs aware of what should and should not be a part of a logged message.


## Events
Your oidc-provider instance is an event emitter, using event handlers you can hook into the various
actions and i.e. emit metrics or that react to specific triggers. In some scenarios you can even
change the defined behavior.  
See the list of available emitted [event names](/docs/events.md) and their description.
