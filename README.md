## Get started
You may check the [example folder](/example) or follow a [step by step example][example-repo] to see
which of those fits your desired application setup.

Also be sure to check the available configuration docs section.

## [Documentation](/docs/README.md) & Configuration

oidc-provider can be mounted to existing connect, express, fastify, hapi, or koa applications, see
[how](/docs/README.md#mounting-oidc-provider). The provider allows to be extended and configured in
various ways to fit a variety of uses. See the [documentation](/docs/README.md).

```js
const { Provider } = require('oidc-provider');
const configuration = {
  // ... see /docs for available configuration
  clients: [{
    client_id: 'foo',
    client_secret: 'bar',
    redirect_uris: ['http://lvh.me:8080/cb'],
    // ... other client properties
  }],
};

const oidc = new Provider('http://localhost:3000', configuration);

oidc.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('oidc-provider listening on port 3000, check http://localhost:3000/.well-known/openid-configuration');
});
```


## Recipes
Collection of useful configurations use cases are available over at [recipes](/recipes).


## Events
oidc-provider instances are event emitters, using event handlers you can hook into the various
actions and i.e. emit metrics that react to specific triggers. See the list of available emitted [event names](/docs/events.md) and their description.
