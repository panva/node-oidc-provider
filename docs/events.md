# Events

Your oidc-provider instance is an event emitter, in the event handlers `this` is always the
Provider instance. In events where
`ctx` (request context) is passed to the listener `ctx.oidc`
[OIDCContext](/lib/helpers/oidc_context.js) holds additional details like recognized parameters,
loaded client or session.
