# Events

Your oidc-provider instance is an event emitter, `this` is always the instance. In events where `ctx`
(request context) is passed to the listener `ctx.oidc` [OIDCContext](/lib/helpers/oidc_context.js) holds additional details like recognized
parameters, loaded client or session.

| interaction.ended | (ctx) | ... whenever interaction has been resolved and the authorization request continues being processed. |
| authorization.success | (ctx) | ... with every successfully completed authorization request. Useful i.e. for collecting metrics or triggering any action you need to execute after succeeded authorization. |
| authorization.error | (error, ctx) | ... whenever a handled error is encountered in the `authorization` endpoint. |
| grant.success | (ctx) | ... with every successful grant request. Useful i.e. for collecting metrics or triggering any action you need to execute after succeeded grant. |

| registration_create.success | (client, ctx) | ... with every successful client registration request. |
| registration_create.error | (error, ctx) | ... whenever a handled error is encountered in the POST `registration` endpoint. |
| registration_read.error | (error, ctx) | ... whenever a handled error is encountered in the GET `registration` endpoint. |
| registration_update.success | (client, ctx) | ... with every successful update client registration request. |
| registration_update.error | (error, ctx) | ... whenever a handled error is encountered in the PUT `registration` endpoint. |
