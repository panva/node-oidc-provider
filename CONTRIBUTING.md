# Contributing to node-oidc-provider
Contributing to node-oidc-provider isn't limited to just filing bugs, users are more than welcomed to make suggestions, report any issue they may find, and make pull requests to help make node-oidc-provider better.

## Working on node-oidc-provider
### Prerequisites
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* Latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Getting node-oidc-provider
1. Fork a copy of our repo
2. Open up Git in an environment of your choice
3. Run the following

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-PROFILE-NAME/node-oidc-provider.git
$ cd node-oidc-provider
```

### Please pay attention to
1. open an issue describing the feature/bug you wish to contribute first to start a discussion, explain why, what and how
2. follow the eslint rules
3. file names in snake_case
4. write tests covering 100% of the library code you produce
5. one PR per feature/fix unless you follow [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) commit guidelines

### Using branches
When working on any issue on Github, it's a good practice to make branches that are specific to the issue you're currently working on. For instance, if you're working on an issue with a name like "NAME OF ISSUE #1234", from the master branch run the following code: `git checkout -b Issue#1234`. In doing so, you'll be making a branch that specifically identifies the issue at hand, and moves you right into it with the `checkout` flag. This keeps your main (master) repository clean and your personal workflow cruft out of sight when making a pull request.
