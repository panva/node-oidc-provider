<a name="5.2.0"></a>
# [5.2.0](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/compare/v5.1.2...v5.2.0) (2018-11-01)


### Draft Features

* sessionManagement feature doesn't set a default thirdPartyCheckUrl anymore ([0015c38](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/commit/0015c38))

With the sunset of https://rawgit.com i'm not going to look for a replacement CDN that hosts github
content using the right content-type. This addition to sessionManagement is a gimmick helping only
in a small % of cases anyway.

Note: Updates to draft and experimental specification versions are released as MINOR library versions,
if you utilize these specification implementations consider using the tilde `~` operator in your
package.json since breaking changes such as this one may be introduced as part of these version updates.

* remove deprecated unused exported errors ([fc3f509](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/commit/fc3f509))
* remove got 8 > 9(retries > retry) option re-assign behaviour ([db31d32](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/commit/db31d32))
* secretFactory is now used in client update ([0923f52](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/commit/0923f52))

* back and front-channel can be enabled without sessionManagement ([8cb37ff](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/commit/8cb37ff))
* dynamic token expiration ([6788b83](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/commit/6788b83))
* enable Certificate Bound Access Tokens ([f43d820](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/commit/f43d820))

* unify audiences helper function signature ([fd38600](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/commit/fd38600))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* the configuration option `pairwiseSalt` is replaced
with `pairwiseIdentifier` async helper function. This allows for
different means of generating the pairwise identifier to be implemented,
such as the ones mentioned in [Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#rfc.section.8.1)
* Passing `scope` to interaction result's `consent`
property is no longer supported
* `cookies.thirdPartyCheckUrl` is now configured
with `features.sessionManagement.thirdPartyCheckUrl` instead
* `features.deviceCode` is now `features.deviceFlow` and `deviceCodeSuccess` helper function is now
`deviceFlowSuccess`
* In order for dynamic token expiration to be able to
pass a client instance to the helpers it is now better to pass a
`client` property being the client instance to a new token instance
rather then a `clientId`. When passing a client the `clientId` will be
set automatically.
* the default adapter format is now set to opaque,
the legacy "legacy" value is still available for legacy deployments but
cannot be combined with the new dynamic format feature option and is
considered deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
* the `default` enabled JWA algorithms have changed. See
the new `whitelistedJWA` configuration option to re-enable the ones you
need.
* the configuration `unsupported` property is removed,
use the configuration `whitelistedJWA` object instead. This isn't a 1:1
renaming of a configuration value, while the `unsupported` option was
essentually a blacklist the `whitelistedJWA` as the name suggests is a
whitelist.
* the `RSA-OAEP-256` key wrapping algorithm has been
removed and is not configurable since it's not supported natively in
nodejs.
* IdToken constructor now requires the client instance
to be passed in as a second argument. IdToken instance `.sign()` now
takes just one argument with the options.
* when a symmetrical endpoint authentication signing alg
is not specified the secret will be validated such that it can be used
with all available HS bit lengths
* audience helper `token` argument will no longer be
a reference to other tokens than the one to which the audiences will be
pushed.
* audience helper `scope` argument is no longer available
* `generateTokenId` format method is now a prototype method instead of a class one
* the http request option `retries` will no longer
be transformed into `retry`, see `got@^9.0.0` package for the `retry`
options
* exported errors `RestrictedGrantType` and
`RestrictedResponseType` are no longer available
* Session.find default upsert behaviour is changed to
return a new empty session instead
* change conformIdTokenClaims default value to true
* custom client metadata properties will not get
transformed between snake_case and camelCase anymore to allow for
namespaced metadata properties such as `custom://metadata`

# Pre standard-version Change Log
## 4.2.x
### 4.2.2
- 2018-07-13 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/compare/v4.2.1...v4.2.2)
- fixed `expiresIn` sent to adapter#upsert when interaction session are saved using interactionFinished()

### 4.2.1
- 2018-07-13 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/compare/v4.2.0...v4.2.1)
- fixed form_post regression for response types including `token` from 4.2.0

### 4.2.0
- 2018-07-12 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/compare/v4.1.3...v4.2.0)

**New Feature - OAuth 2.0 Web Message Response Mode**

Based on [OAuth 2.0 Web Message Response Mode](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sakimura-oauth-wmrm-00)
response_mode=web_message is a new response mode that uses HTML5 Web Messaging instead of a redirect
for the Authorization Response from the Authorization Endpoint. It defines two modes: simple mode
and relay mode. Relay mode can be used to protect the response by confining it within the origins of
a resource server and preventing it from being read by the client.

This is released as an experimental/draft feature so as with the others it is disabled by default and
breaking changes to this feature will be released as MINOR releases. When using Web Message Response
Mode be sure to lock down `oidc-provider` in your package.json with the tilde `~` operator and pay
close attention to this changelog when updates are released.

To enable configure:
```js
const configuration = { features: { webMessageResponseMode: true } };
```
Note: Although a general advise to use a `helmet`([express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet),
[koa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koa-helmet)) it is especially advised for your interaction views
routes if Web Message Response Mode is available on your deployment.

**Enhancements**
- added no-cache headers to the authorization endpoint
- `#provider.setProviderSession()` now returns the created session object
- `#provider.registerGrantType()` also accepts additional parameter to indicate parameters for which
  duplicates are allowed (e.g. `audience` and `resource` in OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange)

**Fixes**
- fixed some edge cases where authorization error responses would still reach the redirect_uri even
  when it could not have been validated
- fixed parameters coming from Request Objects to be always used as strings
- fixed upstream body parser params to be always strings (unless json)
- fixed parameters coming multiple times still being used in error handlers (e.g. state)
- fixed form post values not being html escaped

## 4.1.x
### 4.1.3
- 2018-06-28 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/compare/v4.1.2...v4.1.3)
- fixed `www-authenticate` header uses in bearer token endpoints according to Core 1.0 and RFC6750

### 4.1.2
- 2018-06-26 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/compare/v4.1.1...v4.1.2)
- fixed missing `sid` claim in access tokens
- fixed non-consumable tokens having `consumed` stored and `#consume()` instance method

### 4.1.1
- 2018-06-25 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/compare/v4.1.0...v4.1.1)
- fixed missing `sub` claim from tokens when using the `jwt` format
- chores (lint, tests, refactors, default error and logout screen styles)

### 4.1.0
- 2018-06-22 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/compare/v4.0.3...v4.1.0)

**New Feature - Storage Formats**

Added `formats` configuration option. This option allows to configure the token storage and value
formats. The different values change how a token value is generated as well as what properties get
sent to the adapter for storage. Three formats are defined:

- `legacy` is the current and default format until next major release. no changes in the format sent
  to adapter
- `opaque` formatted tokens have a different value then `legacy` and in addition store what was in
  legacy format encoded under `payload` as root properties, this makes analysing the data in your
  storage way easier
- `jwt` formatted tokens are issued as JWTs and stored the same as `opaque` only with additional
  property `jwt`. The signing algorithm for these tokens uses the client's
  `id_token_signed_response_alg` value and falls back to `RS256` for tokens with no relation to a
  client or when the client's alg is `none`

This feature uses the previously defined public token API of `[klass].prototype.getValueAndPayload,
[klass].prototype.constructor.getTokenId, [klass].prototype.constructor.verify` and adds a new one
`[klass].prototype.constructor.generateTokenId`. See the inline comment docs for more detail on those.
Further format ideas and suggestions are welcome.


**New Feature - `conformIdTokenClaims` feature toggle**
Added `conformIdTokenClaims` feature toggle.

This toggle makes the OP only include End-User claims in the ID Token as defined by Core 1.0 section
5.4 - when the response_type is id_token or unless requested using the claims parameter.


**Fixes**
- fixed edge cases where client and provider signing keys would be used for encryption and vice versa
- fixed client `request_object_signing_alg` and `contact` validations
- fixed `defaultHttpOptions` to be as documented
- fixed an end_session server error in case where session.authorizations is missing - #295
- adjusted error_description to be more descriptive when PKCE plain value fallback is not possible
  due to the plain method not being supported
- fixed `audiences` helper results to assert that an array of strings is returned
- fixed issues with interaction sessions and the back button, assertions are now in place and both
  resume endpoint and interaction helpers will now reject with SessionNotFound named error, which
  is essentially just InvalidRequest with a more descriptive name.


## 4.0.x
### 4.0.3
- 2018-06-09 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/compare/v4.0.2...v4.0.3)
- fixed token endpoint `grant_type=refresh_token` scope parameter related bugs
  - a rotated refresh token will retain the original scope, its only the access and id token that
    has the requested scope as specified in section 6 of RFC6749
  - `openid` scope must be provided in the list of requested scopes

### 4.0.2
- 2018-06-05 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/compare/v4.0.1...v4.0.2)
- fixed non-spec errors `restricted_response_type` and `restricted_grant_type` to be UnauthorizedClient
  (`unauthorized_client`) instead as specified in RFC6749
- fixed missing `WWW-Authenticate` response header in Bearer auth scheme endpoints when 401 is
  returned (was missing from `registration_endpoint`, `registration_client_uri`)
- fixed `#session.save()` when `cookies.*.maxAge` is set to `0` to not add the `exp` claim - #289
- fixed the `remember=false` option to apply to client session state cookies too

### 4.0.1
- 2018-06-01 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/compare/v3.0.3...v4.0.1)

**Breaking changes**
- minimal version of node lts/carbon is required (>=8.9.0)
- **Client Metadata** - null property values are no longer ignored
  - clients pushed through `#initialize()` must not submit properties with null values
  - clients stored via an adapter must be updated in your storage not to have null or
  null-deserialized values, alternatively you can update your adapter not to return these
  properties back to the provider
  ```js
  const _ = require('lodash');
  // your adapter implementation
  class MyAdapter {
    // ...
    async find(id) {
      // load entity properties and then drop the null properties if its a Client adapter instance
      // this is implementation specific
      const data = await DB.query(...);
      if (this.name === 'Client') {
        return _.omitBy(data, _.isNull);
      }
      return data;
    }
    // ...
  }
  ```
- **Client Authentication**
  - Errors related to authentication details parsing and format are now `400 Bad Request` and
    `invalid_request`. Errors related to actual authentication check are now `401 Unauthorized` and
    `invalid_client` with no details in the description.
    This means that errors related to client authentication will no longer leak details back to the
    client, instead the provider may be configured to get these errors from e.g.
    `provider.on('grant.error')` and provide the errors to clients out of bands.
    ```js
    function handleClientAuthErrors(err, { headers: { authorization }, oidc: { body, client } }) {
      if (err instanceof Provider.errors.InvalidClientAuth) {
        // save error details out-of-bands for the client developers, `authorization`, `body`, `client`
        // are just some details available, you can dig in ctx object for more.
        console.log(err);
      }
    }
    provider.on('grant.error', handleClientAuthErrors);
    provider.on('introspection.error', handleClientAuthErrors);
    provider.on('revocation.error', handleClientAuthErrors);
    ```
  - added `WWW-Authenticate` response header to token endpoints when 401 is returned and Authorization
    scheme was used to authenticate and changed client authentication related errors to be `401 Unauthorized`
  - fixed several issues with token client authentication related to `client_id` lookup, it is no longer
    possible to:
    - submit multiple authentication mechanisms
    - send Authorization header to identify a `none` authentication method client
    - send both Authorization header and client_secret or client_assertion in the body
- all error classes the provider emits/throws are now exported in `Provider.errors[class]` instead of
  `Provider[class]` and the class names are no longer suffixed by `Error`. See `console.log(Provider.errors)`
- removed the non-spec `rt_hash` ID Token claim
- `features.pkce` now only enables `S256` by default, this is sufficient for most deployments. If
  `plain` is needed enable pkce with `{ features: { pkce: { supportedMethods: ['plain', 'S256'] } }`.
- `client.backchannelLogout` no longer suppresses any errors, instead rejects the promise
- token introspection endpoint no longer returns the wrong `token_type` claim - #189
  - to continue the support of this non-standardized claim from introspection you may register the following middleware
    ```js
    provider.use(async function introspectionTokenType(ctx, next) {
      await next();
      if (ctx.oidc.route === 'introspection') {
        const token = ctx.oidc.entities.AccessToken || ctx.oidc.entities.ClientCredentials || ctx.oidc.entities.RefreshToken;

        switch (token && token.kind) {
          case 'AccessToken':
            ctx.body.token_type = 'access_token';
            break;
          case 'ClientCredentials':
            ctx.body.token_type = 'client_credentials';
            break;
          case 'RefreshToken':
            ctx.body.token_type = 'refresh_token';
            break;
        }
      }
    });
    ```
- fetched `request_uri` contents are no longer cached for 15 minutes default, cache headers are
  honoured and responses without one will fall off the LRU-Cache when this one is full
- default configuration values for `cookies.short.maxAge` and `cookies.long.maxAge` changed
- `audiences` is now in addition to existing `id_token` and signed `userinfo`
  cases called for `client_credentials` and `access_token`, this is useful for pushing additional audiences
  to an Access Token, these are now returned by token introspection and can be used when serializing
  an Access Token as a JWT
- the provider will no longer use the first value from `acrValues` to denote a "session" like acr.
  In cases where acr is requested as a voluntary claim and no result is available this claim will
  not be returned.
  - to continue the support of the removed behaviour you can change the OIDCContext acr getter
    ```js
    const _ = require('lodash');
    const sessionAcr = '...';
    Object.defineProperty(provider.OIDCContext.prototype, 'acr', {
      get() {
        return _.get(this, 'result.login.acr', sessionAcr);
      },
    });
    ```
  - removed deprecated `#provider.setSessionAccountId()` helper method. Use `#provider.setProviderSession()`
    instead

**Enhancements**
- **Session Changes**
  - stored sessions now have an `exp` property allowing the provider to ignore expired but
    still returned sessions
    - existing sessions without this property will be accepted and the exp property will be added
      with the next save
- bumped the semantic version of every dependency to the latest as of release
- added `aud` to the introspection response if a token has one
- `audiences` helper gets called with additional parameters `use` and `scope`
- `renderError` helper is now called with a third argument that's the actual Error instance.
- `node-jose` dependency bumped to major ^1.0.0 - fixes `A\d{3}GCMKW` symmetrical encryption support
- added `cookies.thirdPartyCheckUrl` option and a warning to host it
- moved middleware handling missing optionally `redirect_uri` parameter case right after loading
  the client

## 3.0.x
### 3.0.3
- 2018-05-23 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/compare/v3.0.2...v3.0.3)
- all options passed to defaultHttpOptions now also reach `request` when `#useRequest()` is used
- fixed a case when RS256 key presence check was wrongly omitted during `#initialize()`
- fixed client `jwks_uri` refresh error to be invalid_client_metadata and propagated to the client

### 3.0.0
- 2018-05-02 [DIFF](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/compare/v2.18.0...v3.0.0)
- fixed `client_secret_basic` requiring the username and password tokens to be `x-www-form-urlencoded`
  according to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1
  - NOTE: Although technically a fix, this is a breaking change for clients with client secrets that
    need to be encoded according to the standard and don't currently do so. A proper way of submitting
    client_id and client_secret using `client_secret_basic` is
    `Authorization: base64(formEncode(client_id):formEncode(client_secret))`. This is only becoming
    apparent for client ids and secrets with special characters that need encoding.

### 2.0.0
*Breaking Changes*
- **oidc-provider now requires node v8.0.0 or higher for ES2015, async function and utils.promisify support**
- **internal koa (and related) dependencies updated to their respective 'next' or koa2 middleware
  compatible versions**
- adapter must now be passed into `#initialize()`
- helper functions which returned or accepted generators will no longer work, use async functions
- helper functions no longer have koa ctx bound to `this`, instead their signature is changed
- interactionUrl helper signature changed to (ctx, interaction) **and is now awaited**
- renderError helper signature changed to (ctx, error) **and is now awaited**
- uniqueness helper signature changed to (ctx, jti, expiresAt)
- interactionCheck helper signature changed to (ctx)
- default interactionCheck helper requires all native application client authorizations to pass
  through interactions
- findById helper signature changed to (ctx, accountId)
- `postLogoutRedirectUri` configuration option is now a helper function and is awaited to
- default acrValues configuration option is now empty, if you used the old values `['0', '1', '2']`,
  you must configure the value explicitly
- `ctx.prompted` renamed to more descriptive `ctx.promptPending`
- **default refreshTokenRotation changed from 'none' to 'rotateAndConsume'**
- pkce.skipClientAuth removed, native clients not willing to submit secrets should be registered
  with method none
- **`features.requestUri` enabled by default with requireRequestUriRegistration**
- **`features.oauthNativeApps` enabled by default**
- `features.oauthNativeApps` automatically enables `features.pkce` with `{ forcedForNative: true }`
- **interaction details no longer utilize cookies to store the details and request parameters,
  short lived sessions are created and maintained via the adapter instead**
- **Integrity keystore is no longer used, random strings are used to generate a lengthy token,
  a none signed JWT is used to store the metadata, keeping the datasets the same as 1.x**
- interaction helper `provider#interactionDetails` now returns a Promise, it reads the short lived
  session id and loads the details using your adapter
- interaction helper `provider.interactionFinished` now returns a Promise, it reads the short lived
  session id and stores the interaction results there
- default token TTLs shortened
- Request Object `iss` (issuer) and `aud` (audience) values are now being validated to be equal to
  Client's identifier (`iss`) and the OP Issuer identifier (`aud`) when present in a Request Object

*New features*
- `static` function named `connect` can now be present on an Adapter prototype, this will be awaited
  during initialization, use to establish the necessary adapter connections
- introspection and revocation endpoint authentication now has dedicated settings and properties,
  unless specific settings for those are provided they default to what's provided for token_endpoint
  equivalents, this allows for fine-tuning while not disrupting existing behavior
- new client metadata supported:
  - introspection_endpoint_auth_method
  - introspection_endpoint_auth_signing_alg
  - revocation_endpoint_auth_method
  - revocation_endpoint_auth_signing_alg
- new configuration properties:
  - introspectionEndpointAuthMethods
  - introspectionEndpointAuthSigningAlgValues
  - unsupported.introspectionEndpointAuthSigningAlgValues
  - revocationEndpointAuthMethods
  - revocationEndpointAuthSigningAlgValues
  - unsupported.revocationEndpointAuthSigningAlgValues
- new discovery properties:
  - introspection_endpoint_auth_methods_supported
  - introspection_endpoint_auth_signing_alg_values_supported
  - revocation_endpoint_auth_methods_supported
  - revocation_endpoint_auth_signing_alg_values_supported
